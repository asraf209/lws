This is the readme file for the lws github repository.

There are files that have been automatically generated by github, as well
as files that are being generated by users.

Authors: Paul Stasiuk, George K. Thiruvathukal, Konstantin LÃ¤ufer from the 
Loyola University Chicago Computer Science Department.

The directory structure of the lws project is as follows:

lws
--client
--server
--stylesheets
--test_scripts

The directories are broken down as the following:
--client--> code that is explicitly meant to run on the client side(the phidget+host device)
	--> using virtualenv for development
--server--> code that is explicitly meant to run on the server side(whatever hosting/centralized system we create).
	--> using virtualenv for development
--stylesheets--> usless,for now. generated by github. takes care of all of styling for the github site
--test_scripts--> scripts used to test various things. normally written as bash scripts, depends on the purpose.
