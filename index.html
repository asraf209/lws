<h2> Loyola Weather Service </h2>
    <p> 

lws is an open source initiative being carried out by a group of researchers at Loyola University Chicago’s Computer Science Department lead by Senior Paul Stasiuk and faculty members George Thiruvathukal and Konstantin Läufer. The intended purpose of this project is to continue an ongoing effort in developing effective environmental monitoring tools that innovate in the field of computer science as well as contribute to a wider, scientific effort to analyze environmental variables and leverage the outputs for various initiatives. 

Our scope is focused on providing a higher awareness and implementation of sustainability. Through the use of these environmental variables and development, we plan on running pilot(s) in various building at the university and gather statistics on the current state. 

A higher level of sustainability can be realistically and easily achieved based on the outputs of the project. For example, the sensors can be placed in offices where they can collect environmental data and control the temperature based on if the offices are in use and report these changes. The savings in electricity(or gas, or water) could be exponentially staggering. This concept or framework could be easily repeated across multiple organizations, office complexes, and other initiatives where sustainability and cost savings are important. 

Scientifically, our research aims to contribute to concepts of RESTful frameworks, as well as a proper implementation of the “Internet of Things” concept(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things). Additionally, we hope to add an element of “parallel processing” leveraging multiple sensors that work in tandem to efficiently utilize resources for processing and aggregation of data.

<!--<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<h3>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
