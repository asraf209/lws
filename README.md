Directory Structure
-------------------

The directory structure of the lws project is as follows:

lws
--client
---old_dev_code
--server
---old_dev_code
--stylesheets
--test_scripts

The directories are broken down as the follows:
--client-->Code that is explicitly meant to run on the client side(the phidget+host device)
	-->Using virtualenv for development
	-->Dependencies on the pythong Requests framework: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/
--server-->Code that is explicitly meant to run on the server side(whatever hosting/centralized system we create).
	-->Currently this code is deployed and running at lws.at-band-camp.net
	-->Includes the aggregation code
	-->Developed for use with the Flask framework. Inlcudes a wsgi script for wsgi based permeant installs
--old_dev_code --> directories that contain snippets of test code

--stylesheets--> usless,for now. generated by github. takes care of all of styling for the github site
--test_scripts--> scripts used to test various things. normally written as bash scripts, depends on the purpose.
